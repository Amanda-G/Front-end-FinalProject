                was inspired by translation software to study coding. My hobbies include reading, tennis, and film.</p>

            <p>I am a curious-minded developer, excited to change the world around me through code! Outside of work, I
                love to travel to new places, try new food recipes, swim, and practice my photography. Check out my

            <h2>Amanda Amador</h2>
            <p>I am a firm believer in the phrase: “do something you love and you’ll never work a day in your life”.
                When it comes to coding, it never feels like work to me because it is my passion. When I started down
                the path of becoming a developer, that is when I finally found my purpose in life.</p>
